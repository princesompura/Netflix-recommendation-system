# Features:
- Netflix-Themed UI: A sleek and modern interface inspired by Netflix.
- Three Recommendation Techniques:
  1. Demographic Filtering: Top-rated movies based on weighted ratings.
  2. Content-Based Filtering: Movies similar to a selected movie.
  3. Collaborative Filtering: Predicts a user's rating for a specific movie.
- Interactive Interface: Built with Gradio for easy interaction.

# Technologies Used :
- Python 3.9 - Core programming language
- Gradio 4.14.0 - Web interface framework
- NumPy 1.21.6 - Numerical computations and array operations
- Pandas 2.0.3 - Data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn 1.3.0 - Machine learning algorithms and data processing
    1. TF-IDF Vectorization
    2. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
    3. Cosine Similarity
- HTML/CSS - Custom styling for Netflix-like interface

# Project Overview :
This project implements a movie recommendation system with three main functionalities: content-based filtering for movie recommendations, weighted rating calculation for top-rated movies, and collaborative filtering for rating predictions. The system uses the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset and features a user-friendly interface styled to match Netflix's aesthetic.
The application demonstrates the practical implementation of various machine learning techniques in creating a recommendation system, combining both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to provide comprehensive movie suggestions to users.
